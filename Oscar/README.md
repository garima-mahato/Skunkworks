# Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Image Captioning Task

## Background

**Image Captioning** generates a description of an image. Thus, it involves both computer vision(CV) and natural language processing(NLP). CV is needed to understand the image, specifically to detect and recognize features, objects, scenes, etc. NLP is needed to generate syntactically and semantically well-formed captions.
